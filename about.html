<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey! I'm Ayush, a student at MNIT Jaipur with a love for building things that actually 
  solve problems. I'm the kind of person who'd rather launch a project than just daydream
  about it. Whether it's working on BnB (BuyNBye), our student resale platform,
  or experimenting with new ideas around campus life, I enjoy blending creativity with 
  practical solutions.

  Beyond the code and startup hustle, I’m someone who enjoys the little quirks of tech,
  meme culture, and making everyday things a bit more fun and efficient. I believe that 
  learning should be hands-on, and every failed idea teaches more than a perfect plan. 
  If you're into building, creating, or even just vibing over smart ideas — we’ll 
  get along just fine.
